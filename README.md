## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Prompt

I am creating a website for the Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund. It is run by an organization of relatives to Gunnar Asplund. It should have three main pages: one about the man himself, one about his works (with subpages for major works) and one about the organization. I am doing this with Next.js. It should be mostly static content. I want the web site to be modern and nice looking. It should be responsive and scale well to mobile. There will be a lot of images, probably presented in something like a carousel.
