        <h1>Erik Gunnar Asplund</h1>
        <p>
          Erik Gunnar Asplund (22 September 1885 â€“ 20 October 1940) was a
          Swedish architect, mostly known as a key representative of Nordic
          Classicism of the 1920s, and during the last decade of his life as a
          major proponent of the modernist style which made its breakthrough in
          Sweden at the Stockholm International Exhibition (1930) marking the
          definitive end of Nordic Classicism.
